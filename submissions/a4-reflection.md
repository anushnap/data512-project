The visualization I created for this project is below.

![Orange County, CA Case counts](../results/orange-county_CA_daily-cases.jpg)

The visualization for this assignment shows the daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the February 1, 2020 through October 15, 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those dates are in the x-axis of the figure. Though the axes labels continue forward into November 2021 for continuity, the data is intentionally truncated at October 15, 2021. The confirmed cases are represented in the y-axis in the representative unit. The figures are reported from Johns Hopkins' University through a publicly-available data set on Kaggle.com.  
The bar element of the figure shows the daily case count of COVID-19 in California's Orange County as extrapolated from the total cumulative case count figures as the bars of the plots. The darker-colored bars indicate that the governing body of the county (either the county government itself or a higher government) imposed a mask mandate. This means that there was a requirement for individuals operating in a personal capacity to wear masks 1) anywhere outside their homes or 2) both in retail businesses and in restaurants/food establishments. This information comes a publicly available data set provided by the Center for Disease Control (CDC). Finally, the thicker orange line in the figure depicts the seven-day rolling average of daily confirmed cases by taking the average cases over the prior seven days (e.g. there is no average for the first seven days because there is insufficient data).  

Second, we would like to understand what you got out of the collaborative activities in this assignment. You should write a reflection statement that highlights one or two specific things that you learned from answering the research question posed in this assignment. Your reflection statement should include specific attributions for any/all code, methods and techniques that you reused. Your reflection statement should be no more than 2 written pages.
