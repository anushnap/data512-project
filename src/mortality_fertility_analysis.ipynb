    "# COVID-19 Effect on Mortality and Fertility in Orange County, California\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation  \n",
    "The datafication of the pandemic has allowed the public access to more health-related data at a granular level than ever before. The county that I was assigned, Orange County, California,  had quite a high number of cases given the high population of the county. The lockdowns and mask mandates enforced did prevent people from leaving their homes and the spread of other diseases like the flu, and likely even other kinds of death. However, at the same time, with hospitals being overloaded and sometimes even needing to turn away patients, I wonder how many deaths there were in excess of what is typical to see in Orange County as this may provide evidence that there were actually more COVID-related deaths than is officially being reported, since the healthcare industry may not want to use tests on already deceased persons. Essentially, this question will help answer if we can be certain that there were more deaths due to the pandemic than what the “official” count may suggest, or if the pandemic reduced other causes of death such as from accidents.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another angle here is that COVID added a lot of uncertainty to the world. This had many adverse effects on people’s lives, and I am curious to see how this affected fertility. Perhaps during these stressful times, fewer people were confident in the future and their ability to support a child, or perhaps quarantine gave people the opportunity to move forward with their family planning because of the flexibility that working from home provided. I would like to inspect the pandemic and its effects on the lives of people in Orange County, CA from the angle of effect on mortality and fertility.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis  \n",
    "My hypothesis related to mortality is that all-cause mortality was higher during the pandemic than pre-pandemic, indicating that there were more deaths due to COVID-19 than were being reported. My hypothesis relating to fertility is that there were fewer births during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic due to the stress and uncertainty it caused.  \n",
