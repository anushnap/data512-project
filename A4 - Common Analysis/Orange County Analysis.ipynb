    "# A4 - Common Analysis  \n",
    "\n",
    "During the last two years we all have been experiencing a global pandemic. This has been tragic and disruptive to many countries and has taken a deep personal toll on many individuals and their families.  \n",
    "One aspect that has been hard to miss in the last two years is the datafication of the pandemic. That is, many aspects of the individual toll of the pandemic have been collected, aggregated and re-represented as data. This datafication gives us the privilege to examine the pandemic from potentially many different perspectives to understand how it has changed lives and how it has changed society. To be honest, we are actually at the very beginning of understanding and comprehending these impacts.  \n",
    "During our Course Project we are going to begin taking a look at some of the social aspects of the pandemic by conducting a human centered data science analysis of some available COVID-19 data. In this Assignment A4: Common Analysis, every student in the course will work from the same datasets. Students will be assigned to analyze data for one specific County of the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 0 - Data Acquisition\n",
    "The common analysis research question will require several different datasets. You will need:  \n",
    "- The RAW_us_confirmed_cases.csv file from the [Kaggle repository of John Hopkins University COVID-19 data.](https://www.kaggle.com/antgoldbloom/covid19-data-from-john-hopkins-university?select=RAW_us_confirmed_cases.csv)  \n",
    "- The [CDC dataset](https://data.cdc.gov/Policy-Surveillance/U-S-State-and-Territorial-Public-Mask-Mandates-Fro/62d6-pm5i) of masking mandates by county.  \n",
    "- The New York Times mask compliance [survey data.](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/mask-use)  \n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of this data is by US County by Day. The mask compliance is a single shot estimator that gives you a compliance estimate for every County in the US. You should carefully review the data descriptions that accompany these datasets. They each have some interesting caveats. As well, some of them are explicit with regard to the way you should interpret missing data.  \n",
